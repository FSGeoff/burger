## Description

-   Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
-   Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
-   Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
-  As an added feature, on the devoured section, there will be an `Un-Devour` button, that when pressed will return the burger to the  not devoured section.
